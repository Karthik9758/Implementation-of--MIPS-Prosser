# Implementation-of--MIPS-Prosser
Designed and simulated a MIPS processor using Verilog HDL based on a 5-stage pipelined architecture. Implements instruction fetch, decode, execute, memory, and write-back stages with basic hazard handling. Verified functionality through simulation to ensure correct instruction flow and processor operation.
